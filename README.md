# IF_IKAO_Massekonvertering
Innlandet fylkesarkiv / interkommunale arkiver Opplandene

A small program used internally in Innlandet county archives to mass convert image files while retaining file- and folder structure.

Uses Image Magick and Ghost script for conversion.

Can convert from JPG, TIF, GIF, and PNG file formats.
Can convert to JPG, TIF, GIF, PNG, and PDF file formats. May also convert to merged PDF files, thereby merging all files per folder (per filetype).

All code is written in English, but the project itself is inherently Norwegian, which is why the GUI contains Norwegian words and sentences.
